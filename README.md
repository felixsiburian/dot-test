# Design Patterns
I usually following the clean code design pattern from Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin.
He divides the pattern into several parts:
controllers -> usecase -> entities

# Note
- Make sure you already have redis install on your device
- run sql1.sql
- make sure your database properties is the same with .env
- run the project `go run main.go`
- you can use the postman collection there
